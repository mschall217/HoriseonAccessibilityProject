## Installation

View my project at https://mschall217.github.io/HoriseonAccessibilityProject/

## Usage

This site was already built to the customers visual dreams the goal was to clean up the back end to make it more user friendly! I took what was already a nicely designed page and mainly defined sections, condensed repetative code, and addded recommended accessibility features.

## Support

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/mschall217/HoriseonAccessibilityProject/issues/new) for support.

## Credits

I'd like to give credit to my Underdogs study group, on Monday we talked through taking the image out of CSS in the heros section to properly give it an alt for accessibility 

As well my tutor Alexandra Noto who talked me through some of my thought processes of this project to help me understand if and why I wanted to do some of the things I did 

Also christianbundy on github who I forked a great template for the README.md to use on any and all future projects
